AI Model Maps Lifetime Disease Risks to Transform Future Healthcare Planning
Date:
September 18, 2025
Summary:
Researchers developed a transformer‑based AI model named
Delphi‑2M
that can predict the progression of 1,256 ICD‑10 “level 3” diseases over decades using past medical history, lifestyle factors, sex, and BMI. Trained on UK Biobank data and validated in a Danish cohort, it can estimate not just whether but
when
conditions may occur, outperforming age‑and‑sex baseline models. The model also simulates life‑long disease trajectories and shows promise for creating synthetic, privacy‑safe health data with only a minor drop in accuracy. While strong overall, it still faces challenges: predictive power decreases for very long horizons, and there are biases stemming from the volunteer participant pool and limited diversity in datasets.

MedAgentBench: Stanford’s New Benchmarking Tool for AI in Healthcare
Date:
September 16, 2025
Summary:
A team at Stanford has released
MedAgentBench
, a new benchmark suite for evaluating AI agents in healthcare workflows using realistic, tool‑based EHR (Electronic Health Record) environments rather than just text or Q&A data. The benchmark includes
300 clinician‑written tasks
across 10 categories like test ordering, medication management, referrals, documentation, and vitals tracking. It’s built on 100 de‑identified patient profiles drawn from over 700,000 records (labs, diagnoses, meds, etc.), and operates via a FHIR‑compliant interface so AI agents can retrieve and modify EHR data. When tested, 12 major LLMs (including Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2, GPT‑4o, etc.) showed strong retrieval performance but lower safe action execution, with the top model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2) achieving ~69.7% success.
